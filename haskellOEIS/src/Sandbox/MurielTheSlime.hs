-- From Jacob in the Math Oasis Discord Chat:

-- Muriel the slime mold sits at position 0 on the number line and weighs 1 unit
-- of slime. She locomotes by spreading slime: at any time, she may average the
-- amount of slime at positions n and n+1 on the number line, where n is an
-- integer.

-- Muriel has a very important date at +âˆž, so she is trying to move her center
-- of mass to the right as fast as possible. The greedy algorithm maximizing
-- change in center of mass at every time step has the following steps:

-- 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3, 1, 0, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 5, ...

-- [3/8, 3/8, 1/4] -> COM = 3/8 + 2*(1/4)
