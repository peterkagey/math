By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on
the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

   3
  7 4
 2 4 6
8 5 9 3

That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.

Find the maximum total from top to bottom in `project_euler/accessory_p067.txt`.

It is not possible to try every route to solve this problem, as there are 2^99
altogether!
If you could check one trillion (10^12) routes every second it would take over
twenty billion years to check them all. There is an efficient algorithm to solve
it. ;o)
